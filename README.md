## Hello Fellow Detectives! 👋

Welcome to the Air-o-Plane project! 🚀 In this small and simple project, I've embarked on a coding journey to showcase my skills in code structure using **Zenject DI**, incorporating various design patterns like **Factory, MVP, MVC,** etc and adhering to **SOLID principles** for a modular and clean architecture.

## Project Overview 📁

### Game Description 🕹️
Air-o-Plane is a retro-style game where you take on the role of a pilot and aim to achieve the maximum distance without any collisions. Get ready to navigate through challenging obstacles and test your flying skills in this exciting adventure!

## Technology Stack 🛠️

**Unity Game Engine**:- The core engine for game development.<br>
**Zenject DI**:- Used for dependency injection to promote modularity and maintainability.<br>
**Design Patterns**:- Employed Factory, MVP, MVC patterns etc for an organized and scalable codebase.<br>
**SOLID Principles**:- Ensured adherence to SOLID principles for robust and flexible code.<br>
**Unity Test Framework with NUni**t:- Implemented testing to ensure the reliability of the codebase.

## Work in Progress 🚧

This project is a continuous **work in progress**, and I encourage you to explore the codebase and provide feedback. Feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions to help me improve and refine the project.

### How to Contribute 🤝

If you'd like to contribute to the project, here's how you can get started:
